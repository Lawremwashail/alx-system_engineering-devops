Postmortem Report: Point of Sales (POS) System Outage
Issue Summary
Duration: 
The outage lasted for 3 hours, from 10:00 PM to 1:00 AM on August 15, 2024.
Impact: 
During the outage, the POS system was completely inaccessible, resulting in a halt in sales processing for all users. Approximately 60% of users, especially the ones who operate within the timeframe were affected, preventing businesses from processing transactions, which led to significant downtime for small and medium enterprises relying on the system.
Root Cause: 
The root cause was a misconfigured database query that led to a deadlock situation, causing the entire database to become unresponsive.
Timeline
10:00 PM: 
The issue was detected when the monitoring system alerted that the response time of the POS API had exceeded acceptable limits.
10:15 PM: 
Engineers noticed that the database queries were not returning any data, and CPU usage on the database server was unusually high.
10:30 PM: 
Initial investigation focused on potential network issues or database server hardware failure, as it was assumed these were causing the slowdown.
10:50 PM: 
The team attempted to restart the database server, but this did not resolve the issue, leading to further investigation.
11:00 PM: 
It was discovered that certain database queries were causing a deadlock, preventing other queries from executing.
11:30 PM: 
The issue was escalated to the database administration team for deeper analysis.
11:45 PM: 
The deadlock was identified in a specific query related to inventory updates, and the query was isolated.
12:00 AM: 
The offending query was optimized and re-deployed.
1:00 PM: 
Normal operations were restored, and the system was back online.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause 
The issue was caused by a complex query that involved multiple tables (Sales, Inventory, and User). Its design resulted in a deadlock because it locked the Inventory table in a way that made it impossible for other transactions to access it. The database was hung due to a deadlock, which prevented it from processing queries until the issue was fixed.
Resolution 
The database query was broken down into smaller transactions and steps that were easier to manage. Instead of trying to update multiple tables in a single transaction, the new approach separates the inventory update and sales logging into two distinct operations. This prevented locking issues and significantly reduced the risk of deadlocks. Additionally, the query execution plan was analyzed, and indexes were optimized to ensure faster execution times.
Corrective and Preventative Measures
Improvements:
Query Optimization:
 All complex queries will undergo a thorough review to ensure they are optimized and do not cause locking issues.


Database Monitoring: 
Enhance monitoring of the database, specifically focusing on long-running queries and potential deadlocks.
Load Testing: 
Implement load testing in the staging environment to simulate high transaction volumes and identify potential bottlenecks before deployment.
Tasks:
Add Monitoring on Server Memory: 
Implement memory usage monitoring to detect unusual spikes in resource consumption.
Review and Optimize All Queries: 
Perform a comprehensive review of all database queries in the POS system to identify and optimize any other potentially problematic queries.
Enhance Alerting Mechanisms: 
Implement more granular alerts for database performance metrics, such as query execution time and lock wait time.
Documentation: 	
Document the issue and resolution process to ensure that similar problems can be quickly identified and resolved in the future.
